Historical-Climate-Visualization
================================

A vis project from when I was in grad school. Built using VTK in Python, out of legal concerns I won't distribute the data I used here, although it is freely and publicly available (US HCN) and to the best of my knowledge thoroughly vetted and of the highest quality obtainable by the general public.

All the interesting stuff is in final_project.py, as it was a final project for a class. I like it anyway, but also as a starting point for some interesting visual stuff and I expect I'll be returning to work on it over time.

Using this program, a video is produced which shows a visualization of Earth's climate changing from about the 1800's to 2011 as recorded by scientists. The video that is produced varies based on a number of settable paramaters, but these are not necessarily explicit.
